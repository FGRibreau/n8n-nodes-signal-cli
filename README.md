* Triggers when a new message is received via Signal CLI.
* Requires [Signal CLI](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) API credential.
* Parameters:
  * `account`: Signal account to listen for incoming messages.

### 📱 Signal

* Interact with Signal CLI API for various operations.
* Requires Signal CLI API credential.
* Supports the following resources and operations:
  * **Message**:
    * Send: Send a message to a recipient or group.
      * Parameters: `account`, `recipient`, `message`
  * **Group**:
    * Create: Create a new group.
      * Parameters: `account`, `name`, `members`
    * List: List all groups.
      * Parameters: `account`
  * **Contact**:
    * Update: Update a contact's name.
      * Parameters: `account`, `recipient`, `name`
    * List: List all contacts.
      * Parameters: `account`
  * **Reaction**:
    * Send: Send a reaction to a message.
      * Parameters: `account`, `recipient`, `reaction`, `targetAuthor`, `timestamp`
    * Remove: Remove a reaction from a message.
      * Parameters: `account`, `recipient`, `reaction`, `targetAuthor`, `timestamp`
  * **Receipt**:
    * Send: Send a receipt (read or viewed) for a message.

  * **Attachment**:
    * Get: Download a received attachment by its id (returns binary data).
      * Parameters: `account`, `attachmentId`, `recipient` or `groupId`, `binaryPropertyName`

## 💻 Development

* Run `pnpm dev` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.
* Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting errors.
* Run `pnpm test` to run integration tests.

Before running the tests, set the `ENDPOINT` environment variable to the Signal CLI API URL (e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:8085").

For example, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:8085" # signal-cli endpoint
export ACCOUNT_NUMBER="+33620382719" # your phone number in international format
```


## 🚀 Release

* Run `pnpm release` to release a new version of the package.
